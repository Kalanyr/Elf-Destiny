Here among the debris sits a long dead king; his throne his final resting place. Around his neck hangs a radiant amulet.

Upon seeing her shocked face and pointing at your head you reach your hand up and confirm that yours have grown as well. "M'[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], we seem to have been transformed into elves! Like the legendary people of old!" You look at the gem still clutched in your hand in wonder. What this change truly means for you is yet to be discovered"
