# Priority: Urgent

Getting a bug where I have the empty council position notification event though my council is full. I guess this might be to do with the sister council position but it is bothering me a lot so I hope you can fix it.

Hi, it looks like after i changed to ascended tribal, i can't change out of confederate partition. I can only change the ruler prefered sex, but cant change to primogeniture/ultimogeniture ecc.
Is it just me or is it intended?

# Priority: Important

- elf blood aastru/norse, stuck in matchmaking request loop. couldnt get further than allowing them to find a match for player.
- familial familiarity may not be allowing family marriage
- The event for choosing a marriage candidate doesn't work if you haven't done the expedition or are an elf, as it doesn't generate anyone or give any options to the player. So if you were to convert to Aeluran Weavers the event fires repeatedly but nothing ever happens.

It seems like if you don't have the Noble husbandry tradition and two people with top traits have children the trait can still reinforce, however it leads to losing the trait altogether. In my case I've had two geniuses have children and they end up without any intellect trait altogether (checked for bastardry as well).

I hadnt thought that a possibility..  thought the game would handle that.... sigh may have to revert back to my manual inheritance script

what I could do is allow people whos parent had genius to get the tier 4 trait, then immediately on birth (or rather right before it) swap out tier 4 for tier 3 if they dont meet the culture requirements

# Priority: Mid
- "Host A Expedition" localization fix
- Tribal Ascension: you'll turn into a theocracy and get a game over. This happens once you turn your tribal lands feudal.
- True Elf and higher tiers don´t have a "years_of_fertility" bonus like the lower tiers?
- Aeluran Advisor fineshes the "Undermine" task without results.
- people who already have elf culture/religion run into weirdness when they convert in main quest
- Aeluran advisor may be causing some real relam preist asignment problems, check issues comment for more

# Priority: low
- divinic_empowerment is still used or listed somewhere
