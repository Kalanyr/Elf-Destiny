Dicord Idea: Bot that allows people to pick three personality traits, maybe part of onboarding


Gold duck idol: when owned not even equipped grants its own special tradition. Its a prosperity totem so art is the statue on a platform surrounded by ocean with fish jumping out

   lifestyle trait: Spiritualist
   lifestyle trait: Warlock (dark spiritualist)

   secret ways to learn languages

   with rats coming to the game, have a pied piper ability to control rat waves, could be a military unit and a way to spread plague at will

   tradition idea: Tavern Network
