# Beta_v1.0.10

Religion
- following up on the court priest/aeluran advisor hotfix
  - both positions should now autofill again. Aeluran advisor uses a custom script so it may take a couple months to happen.

Traditions
- Heroic Courage:
  - It actually works now!
  - Heroic Personality is no longer part of the general personality trait pool so random people wont just have it.
  - Kills gotten through duels now count towards the unlock.
- Tribal Ascension
  - feudal holdings are now build-able
- Fey Agoras
  - effect now should apply to courtiers as well

GUI
- fixed liege council for when they dont have an Aeluran Advisor

Evolved Traits
- stream-lined and simplified the tier 4 genetic inheritance in the backend, players probably wont notice any difference.
