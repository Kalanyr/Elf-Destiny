# Beta_v1.0.3

- Expedition Trials being triggered should be more consistent. (One trial per expedition, not repeat spammed).
    - There may still be an issue with the tutorial trial people are having do to a mod conflict. If you see that come report it and provide your debug/error logs when it happens! (and mod list plz)

- Quest Items (Sigil of the Realm Lord/Portal Spark Capacitor/Portal Navigation Relay)
    - all are now equippable (honestly this may be the top complaint I've had so far lol)
    - all have slick new art! go check it out
    - readjusted the modifiers they give you

- Localization
    Fixed some of the infamous <insert name here> tags I left laying about. (...only some)
