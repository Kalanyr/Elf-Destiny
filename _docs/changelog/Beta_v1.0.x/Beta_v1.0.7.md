# Beta_v1.0.7

Nerfed Elven Superiority tradition hard!
    - when you had a large dynasty the gains were ridiculous
    - +.5 flat per character => +10% per character

Added a nvm option to Aeluran matchmaking after seeing the options and a piety cost for refusing them
    - future state will add a "Dont bother me for 10 years" option
    - eventually when I do the "Respect" mechanic there will be no piety cost for refusing if they respect you enough
