# Beta_v1.0.5

Traditions
    - Woodland Bounty: Now actually Works!
        - you can build woodland farms in forest and taigas
    - Tribal Ascension: Now Actually Works! (I think)
        - now properly unlocks two additional levels for all tribal buildings
        - now should allow you to construct additional tribal holdings
        - now should give you alot of the perks of Feudal governments like changing succession laws and removing the development penalty.
        - Some of these "Fixes" im more confident are working than others so please keep reporting bugs as you find them.

Expeditions
    - added a minor event where you discover a small bit of gold!
