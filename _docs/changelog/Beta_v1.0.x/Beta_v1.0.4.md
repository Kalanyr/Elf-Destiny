# Beta_v1.0.4

- 1066 is online!
- Expedition cooldown changed from 1 year => 2 years
- Re-fixed True Elf trait inheritance again, this time its personal.
- removed elf trait tracks for now, they dont do anything yet. Will add back when they are further developed.
- might have fixed the Julia Melwood not existing, people getting stuck at the tutorial bug.
- until "Aeluran Respect" mechanic is properly set up, swapped matchmaking over to just look at elf trait level and highest title tier to determine match quality. You may notice you suddenly have new better options occasionally! You also might notice new bugs... its mostly untested.
